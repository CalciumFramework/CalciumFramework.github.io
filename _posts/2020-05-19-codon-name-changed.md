It's been a little under 3 years since we renamed Calcium to Codon. 
Over the last few months we've been considering going back to our
roots and reverting to our old name. Today, we finally put 
that decision in place. With the upcoming release of WinUI 3
and .NET 5, we have a lot of exciting updates on the cards.
Welcome back Calcium!
